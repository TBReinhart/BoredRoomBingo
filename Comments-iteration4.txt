Group 11,

ErrorMessage.m is still duplicated (it also occurs under Errors), and you still haven't fixed the OCP violation.
Since you insist on using your regex to validate emails, here are some valid emails which it will reject:
    webmaster@m√ºller.de
    "Fred Bloggs"@example.com
    \$A12345@example.com
    Chuck Norris <gmail@chucknorris.com>
Of these, I think the first and last are of more concern. Also, you have not attributed the regex; I'm pretty sure you didn't write it yourself. You might also consider the regex [here](http://www.ex-parrot.com/pdw/Mail-RFC822-Address.html), which is RFC compliant (for the earlier RFC).
Your iteration plan is a bit sparse.

Otherwise, good job.

Total Score: 96/100

Group 11,

Your did a good job motivating and providing an overview of your project. For the most part, you succeeded in conveying the information necessary.

However:
  - I feel like the lack of any sort of slide deck detracted from your presentation, both in terms of organization and in term of audience understanding.
  - You had technical difficulties which lost you time.
  - You hesitated a lot while you were presenting
All this put together meant that you were a bit short on time.

Total Score: 95/100

Group 11,

Although it's a minor point, you should probably have an index.html.

Your gui sketches do a good job of conveying what features you will be implementing and how you will present them to users of your app.

Your component diagram is mentions Android, but you have decided to drop support for that OS.

Your feature list, although good for core features, is missing extended features, which were required.

Your use cases don't really have main or alternate paths (numbered lists of steps that a user will take); what you have as paths are more like summaries or post-conditions.
You should also probably have a use-case for "select word".

Your activity diagram is good.

Your architecture section focuses less on architecture and more on things that should be in the features list (and mentions Android again); your component diagram is, however, a good visualization of your architecture.

Overall, you did a good job, but there are numerous minor mistakes.

Total Score: 96/100
